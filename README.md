My self-study Python scripts exploring functions, loops, conditionals, and more.

# 🧠 Python Self-Study Scripts

This repository contains small Python programs I wrote while teaching myself the basics of programming, since I'm a beginner.  
Each script explores a few new concepts — like printing, functions, loops, conditionals, and list iteration.

## 🐍 What’s Inside
- `selfstudy.py` → My first full experiment combining all the basics.  
- Comments throughout the code explaining what each section does.  
- Future scripts will go here as I keep learning!

## 💬 Why I Made This
I wanted to learn Python by experimenting instead of following only tutorials —  
so this repo is my little record of progress. Lazy way? Maybe. But fun? Definitely 😄

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add input-based mini projects  
- Try small games like “Guess the Number”  
- Practice file handling and basic data structures
